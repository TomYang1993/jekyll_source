## HTTP is stateless ? #
what does that even mean? It means that HTTP belongs to the world and it has no nationality, every man on the earth can use it. Do you believe that?

Just kidding! It means every HTTP request is a new action. The server or client who uses the server won't remember they have connected once, they don't remember anything and every request is a new connection. So no one will remember the state such as user's password, user's id, user's email. so it is stateless!

## So who remembers or carries the info ? #
Cookies! I won't dig into cookies, maybe next post. Cookies can tell a particular user who is logged in as the current user, and sessions will store some useful data about the user. When you want to keep track of data in the user's session, which represents all the stuff your user does while you've chosen to remember the user, typically until the browser window is closed. In that case, every page he visits until the browser is closed will be part of the same session.

So sessions can retain info during multiple requests, and users will always have data in the session even though the HTTP is stateless.

>HTTP is a stateless protocol. Sessions make it stateful. ------ rails guide

>Most applications need to keep track of certain state of a particular user. This could be the contents of a shopping basket or the user id of the currently logged in user. Without the idea of sessions, the user would have to identify, and probably authenticate, on every request. Rails will create a new session automatically if a new user accesses the application. It will load an existing session if the user has already used the application. ------ rails guide

##  Session in an app  #
Sessions can store a lot of info, I will take the minicapstone as example, to explain the sessions. And this is only an example, other usages of session will be for you to explore.

Now we have an app, and it has a user model.

{% highlight ruby %}
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_secure_password
  has_many :orders
  has_many :carted_products
  has_many :products, through: :carted_products

  validates :name, :email, :password, presence: true
  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true
  validates :password, presence: true, length: {minimum: 8}
end
{% endhighlight %}

{%highlight ruby%}
create_table "users", force: :cascade do |t|
  t.string   "name"
  t.string   "email"
  t.string   "password_digest"
  t.datetime "created_at",                      null: false
  t.datetime "updated_at",                      null: false
  t.boolean  "admin",           default: false
{%endhighlight%}


**So I can create a user(normally it is the user who put in the data) which contains his id and other info in the database, and database is acting as my server now. Follow the route below.**

  {%highlight ruby%}
  get '/signup' => 'users#new'
  post '/users' => 'users#create'
  {%endhighlight%}

  **Now I have two users!**

  **Now we have to make sure when a user log in, his info will be saved and used until the user log out. First, we set the route and create a session controller.**

  {%highlight ruby%}
  get '/login' => 'sessions#new'
  post '/login' => 'sessions#create'
  delete '/logout' => 'sessions#destroy'
  {%endhighlight%}


  {%highlight ruby%}
  def new
    render "new.html.erb"
  end

  def create
    user = User.find_by(email: params[:email])
    if user && user.authenticate(params[:password])
      session[:user_id] = user.id
      flash[:success] = "Successfully logged in!"
      redirect_to '/products'
    else
      flash[:warning] = "Invalid password or email!"
      redirect_to '/login'
    end
  end

  def destroy
    session[:user_id] = nil
    session[:cart_count] = nil
    flash[:success] = "Successfully logged out!"
    redirect_to "/login"
  end
  {%endhighlight%}

  **When we go to the login page and hit "log in", we are hitting the session controller's create action. If the email and password are correct, it gives session a user's id and now session can tell between the two users. Along with creating, there is a destroy action when a user decide to log out and his info will be wiped out in the system because session has been set to nil.**

  **And what? It seems useless! It is doing nothing!**

  **That's not true!**


  {%highlight ruby%}
  def current_user
    @current_user ||= User.find_by(id: session[:user_id]) if session[:user_id]
  end
  helper_method :current_user
  {%endhighlight%}

**In the application controller, you can find your current user by the info stored in the session, for example: user_id. Now you can always track your current user! That is because even if every request wipes out instance variable, when you call `current_user`, it will reset the current_user variable and always keep the variable up to date!**

**Then you are free to use current_user in the view or in the controller and don't have to worry about web requests take away the values of the variables!**
